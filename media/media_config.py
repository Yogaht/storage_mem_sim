    """Configuration for a media simulation backend.

    Attributes:
        media_type: Which backend to use (ANALYTIC, RAMULATOR, MQSIM).
        config_path: Path to the backend-specific configuration file
                     (YAML for Ramulator, XML for MQSim, unused for Analytic).
        capacity: Device capacity in GB.
        bandwidth: Peak bandwidth in GB/s (used by Analytic backend
                   and MQSim fallback).
        io_frequency: I/O clock frequency in MHz (used by Ramulator to convert
                      cycles → time: scale_factor = 1.0 / (io_frequency * 10^6)).
        granularity: Access granularity in bytes. For Ramulator, auto-derived
                     from DRAM spec; fallback for other backends.

        # MQSim-specific
        ssd_config_path: Path to MQSim ssdconfig.xml.
        workload_config_path: Path to MQSim workload.xml.
        mqsim_binary_path: Path to MQSim binary (auto-detect if empty).

        # Bandwidth / IOPS bound control
        io_pattern: Access pattern — "sequential" (bandwidth-bound) or
                    "random" (IOPS-bound).
        request_size_bytes: Typical request size in bytes.
                            Large → bandwidth-bound, small → IOPS-bound.
